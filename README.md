# technical_imp

A Flutter project for Technical Test at IMP

## What inside this project?

Create a project using Flutter with the following requirements:

Create CRUD pages for listing posts, showing post detail, create post, and edit post
Utilize the endpoints in "Endpoint Testing Applicant IMP"
Use Flutter package for component
Use package  flutter_form_builder for form validations
Use package dio for data fetching
Use state management concepts

Notes: We want to see how you solve the requirements above. You do not need to have a complex UI design as the Flutter has sensible defaults that you can leverage. We expect the project would take 4-5 hours for the functionality to be there.

Host the finished project with a proper README file in Git repository services such as GitHub and GitLab and share the link with us, then set the GitHub and GitLab to auto build the apk.
