Create a project using Flutter with the following requirements:

- Utilize the endpoints in "Endpoint Testing Applicant IMP"
- Use Flutter package for component
- Use package  flutter_form_builder for form validations

Notes: We want to see how you solve the requirements above. You do not need to have a complex UI design as the Flutter has sensible defaults that you can leverage. We expect the project would take 4-5 hours for the functionality to be there.
